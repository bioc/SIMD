Description: This package provides a inferential analysis method 
    for detecting differentially expressed CpG sites in MeDIP-seq data. It uses 
    statistical framework and EM algorithm, to identify differentially expressed 
    CpG sites. The methods on this package are described in the article 
    'Methylation-level Inferences and Detection of Differential Methylation 
    with Medip-seq Data' by Yan Zhou, Jiadi Zhu, Mingtao Zhao, Baoxue Zhang, 
    Chunfu Jiang and Xiyan Yang (2018, pending publication).
